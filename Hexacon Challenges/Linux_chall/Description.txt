This challenge is a keygen where you need to generate a flag that satisfies certain conditions. The binary is protected.

The first layer of protection involves an obfuscated loader. The challenge lies in deciphering the code, which is not clear until execution time. Once you've uncovered the code, your task is to generate a flag based on the conditions specified within it.
